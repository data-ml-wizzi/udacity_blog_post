### 1. Installations ###
You need the following package installations for your python environment to compile the code.

pandas      == 2.2.3
numpy       == 2.2.1
seaborn     == 0.13.2
matplotlib  == 3.10.0
tqdm        == 4.67.1

### 2. Project Motivation ###
I am doing a Data Science Nanodegree on Udacity. Part of that course is a project to write your own Blog Post Entry. Herefore different sources of data where offered. I opted for the AirBnB Data from Seattle and Boston hosted on Kaggle.


### 3. File Descriptions ###
data                > includes the AirBnB .csv files for Boston and Seattle from Kaggle
blog_post.ipynb     > includes the complete Data Exploration, Preparation, Visualization and Analysis
requirements.txt    > includes all packages needed for your Python environment    

### 4. Summary ###
Did you ever wonder, at what time of the year you should list your home on AirBnB and at which price? And how important your rating is? I analysed AirBnB Data from Seattle and Boston hosted on Kaggle and try to answer these questions.

I personally thought, that seasonal trends, prices and an listings rating have an substantial effect on its booking quota. But as it turnes out espacially price and rating are overrated factors. A deeper analysis has to be done to find out the driving factors for the booking quota.
